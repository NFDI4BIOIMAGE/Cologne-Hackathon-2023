## Introduction / Summary

**REMBI**: **RE**commended **M**etadata for **B**iological **I**mages

The REMBI publication can be read here: https://rdcu.be/dsDc6.  
At this Hackathon, we used a REMBI template which is used at CAi at HHU Duesseldorf.  
The CAi REMBI template is adapted from the REMBI table in the supplementary information of the REMBI publication: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01166-8.
