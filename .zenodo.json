    "description": "This is the repository for documentation during the first NFDI4Bioimage - TA3-Hackathon - UoC-2023 (in short: Cologne Hackathon). Potential topics were identified in a preparatory meeting and covered with introductory talks. In a joint discussion and workflow as well as roadmap session, graphical workflows were created and tasks were defined. Eventually intensive work on the topics 'Interoperability', 'REMBI / Mapping', 'Neuroglancer (OMERO / zarr)' was conducted in groups and final reports summarized the outcome of this initial hackathon which also bridged from NFDI4Bioimage to DataPLANT on the topic of OMERO-ARC interoperability. From the beginning, there was a focus on documentation and on including use cases. The interoperability and REMBI topic served as preparatory work for a project at the 2nd de.NBI BioHackathon in Bielefeld: 'Towards OMERO and ARC interoperability for RDM-compliant bio-image data'. For the OMERO-ARC topic, we are thankful for the collaboration with DataPLANT (funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) within the framework of the NFDI - project numbers: 442077441). We thank Heinrich Lukas Weil (DataPLANT) for participating and contributing as a guest, also providing the introductory talk on ARC. Furthermore, we acknowledge the contribution of Timo Mühlhaus in discussions during planning for the OMERO-ARC project and of Kevin Schneider in preparatory meetings on the OMERO-ARC project (both: DataPLANT). Funding allowing this event including enabling for organization, participation and finalizing this repository including the Zenodo submission: NFDI4Bioimage, funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) within the framework of the NFDI-project numbers: 501864659; CEPLAS, Cluster of Excellence on Plant Sciences, funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy, EXC-2048/1'; CECAD, Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases, funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy - EXC 2030 - 390661388; CRC TRR341, Funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) - Project-ID 456082119.",
