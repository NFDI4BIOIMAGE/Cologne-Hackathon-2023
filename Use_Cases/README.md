### One KVP-list per excel sheet:
In Omero (only available in UoC campus network): <br />
https://omero-3-web.cecad.uni-koeln.de/webclient/?show=project-1305


The omero-links only work in the Cologne campus network (including eduroam), see here for Omero access details: [Omero accounts](https://github.com/NFDI4BIOIMAGE/Cologne-Hackathon-2023/blob/main/Installation_Instructions/OMREO/Installation_Instructions.md#access-to-the-omero-test-server-at-university-of-cologne)

You can import this project in your own Omero server by [omero-cli-transfer](https://github.com/ome/omero-cli-transfer/releases) using this tarball: [file, 700MB](https://uni-koeln.sciebo.de/s/6QuSW8GEUM20KqG)
