# Contributing

Optimal repository contributions during the Hackathon need to be decided on.

Suggestion:
- Protect the main branch.  
- Work in the directories of the respective topic using branches.  
- Request one review for a PR into main.  
- Start in private mode and decide together if, when and what can be set public (moved to a public repository).
